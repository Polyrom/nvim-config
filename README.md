### My custom Neovim config

As usual, the config is work in progress: I sometimes customize the plugin set and remaps to achieve
optimal workflow as a backend dev in my attempt to fully separate from heavyweight IDEs.

The basic set was fully inspired by [Primeagen's 0 to LSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) tutorial
(yep, [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) is there, actually love it).
